          I'm a self-taught programmer on a journey to becoming a full-stack

            <h3>Customer service</h3>
            <p>
              I believe in putting others before yourself and this phrase rings
              true in any industry. I have over 6 years experience in all types
              of customer service roles from sales to delivery and one thing
              stands out - it's all about the people.

            <h3>Driving</h3>
            <p>
              Whether it's a Honda, Toyota or Subaru - or even a driving sim - I
              love getting behind the wheel of a car. Nothing gets my adrenaline
              pumping more than slinging a four-wheeled machine on some tarmac.
